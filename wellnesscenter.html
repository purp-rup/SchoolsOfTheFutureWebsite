    <h1>Health & Wellbeing</h1>
    <p>The Philadelphia Community Free School offers our wellness center. At our
      school we value the development of each child, along with their health and
      well-being. Our wellness center focuses on physical health as well as mental
      health. Here at Philadelphia Community Free School, we feel that much of the
      success in students is backed by healthy students. When walking into our
      center you are welcomed with a warm comfortable inviting environment. We
      are adequately staffed with six nurses, three doctors, and ten counselors.

        <p>Our staff is held to their highest regards in their professionalism and their confidentiality. We take pride in knowing every student will feel safe coming to see any of our staff here. All of our counselors are social workers trained and licensed in childhood development. They offer a wide range of workshops to help students manage their emotions, reduce stress, de-escalate confrontation, and healthy coping mechanisms.</p>
        <p>Along with the mental health aspect, we offer physical wellness as well. This includes regular check-ups twice a year. These checkups include a full physical, hearing exam, and eye exam. Should the child need any accommodation stemming from the check up the school will follow up with the doctor and try to the best of their ability to fulfill the needs of the child. We know health care can be expensive for families and our goal here is to try and lighten the burden on families and give our students the best opportunities for them to achieve their goals.</p>

      <div class="wellness-body-col">
        <p>We want to note that when we incorporate the aspect of mental health into our services for students, we directly support the aspect for social and emotional learning. When students learn how to regulate their emotions and proper conflict resolution techniques, we have proven this has reduced the issues of conflict among students in our school. In our group-building workshops we promote teamwork, building long-lasting friendships and positive interactions with the staff and among students.</p>
        <p>While our main focus is always on our students, we highly encourage their families to get involved also. Here, we have many opportunities for family members to get involved with our mental health development. We also extend our support outside of school and encourage you as parents and caregivers to get involved. Please reach out to the school regarding any of these activities.</p>

    <div class="funding-row full-bleed-dark">
      <p>Our goal by providing these services is to create healthy well-rounded students that all have equal opportunities to succeed in school. We cannot express how important we feel it is to extend the benefits of our wellness center to helping the students. Our hope is to create a tight-knit healthy environment backed by a supporting and caring staff.</p>
