    <h1>Free Community School Education Grant</h1>
    <p>At the Philadelphia Community Free School our main base of funding is
      through the government. Since Title 1 has been dismantled due to the budget
      cuts we rely solely on specialized grants from the government. Every year our
      school applies for the Free Community School Education Grant (FCSEG). This is
      a specialized grant only offered to schools who facilitate in “free”
      community-based environment and nonprofit organizations. This grant is
      only available for schools operating up to eighth grade.

      <div class="funding-body-col">
        <p>With this grant we are able to receive up to one million dollars every
          five years. With these funds we are able to provide our wellness center,
          boarding for fostered and homeless children, and all our supplies we provide
          for our staff. We invest this money in the development of our specialized
          community-based curriculum. We invest in our dedication to hiring our diverse
          staff to reflect the local population, and lastly in our dedicated nurses,
          doctors, and social workers.</p>
        <p>Some specialized programs we offer are mental health workshops that we offer
          inside and outside of the school, we love to promote family engagement. Other
          services we use our funding for are STEM programs and specialized life skills
          programs. Some of these life skill programs include cooking, building, and
          financial literacy classes. We believe these courses help set up our students
          for life success outside of the classroom.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="funding-body-col">
        <p>In addition to the grant we receive, we host many fundraisers and community
          events to help raise money for our school. We encourage our students, their
          families, and our staff to participate in these events to help promote our
          community-based structure. Some of the examples we do are bake sales,
          selling stuff the students have made in class, and inviting vendors to
          come and donate some of their proceeds to our school.</p>
        <p>We also take in donations such as clothes, personal hygiene supplies, and
          food. Since we offer housing for our foster and homeless children, we
          appreciate anything that can be contributed. We have a pantry at our school
          so that items can be dropped off. Any items that you would like to be
          donated can be dropped off during school hours (8am–4pm). We accept items
          at all fundraisers and events also.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="funding-row full-bleed-dark">
      <p>I would like to note that all proceeds, donations, and money made during
        fundraising goes directly to our school. We use one hundred percent of our
        profits to benefit the students and help make our school a better place for
        all that are there. We would like to thank everyone for their participation
        in any event we have held or donations you may have offered, they help our
        students more than you know.</p>
