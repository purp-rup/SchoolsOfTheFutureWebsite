          <h1>We are the blah blah</h1>
          <p>Born from the ashes of a broken education system, the Philadelphia Community Free
            School is a revolutionary rethinking of what education can look like. We are
            a K–8 school dedicated to diversity, equity, and well-being—built for students
            from all kinds of backgrounds. We are student-driven, rooted in free school
            philosophy of the past, and founded on the belief that education can be liberating,
            not restrictive.</p>
          <p>Education here takes place in secure, home-like environments, with accompanying
            mental health and medical treatment all on-site through our wellness center. We
            are proud to provide boarding for homeless and fostered youth, giving them a
            stable, nurturing environment where they can grow and thrive. Classrooms are
            adapted to different learning styles through multimedia resources like videos
            and audiobooks.</p>
          <p>Fundamentally supported in the same manner as public schools, we are also still
            community-driven—having events and drives to emphasize the importance of community.
            The Philadelphia Community Free School is not just some place to be educated—it is
            home and a movement toward something greater.</p>

    <!--- Our Curriculum --->
    <section class="curriculum full-bleed-dark" id="curriculum">
      <h1>Our Curriculum</h1>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="curriculum-col">
          <p>At PCFS our curriculum is built around student centered learning. We encourage
            self discovery and encourage students' individual interest by providing them with
            optional concentrations in specialized subjects. </p>
          <h3>Cultivating Interest</h3>
          <p>Students are exposed to a wide range of interests through their early education at
            PCFS. Through play based learning the students are encouraged to pursue their interests
            and explore the potential careers society has to offer. Learning and exploring these
            options through play in early development can cultivate a natural curiosity and
            excitement for learning to carry the students through schooling with purpose. </p>
          <h3>Core Subjects</h3>
          <p>A large concern surrounding student centered learning is the fear that students will
            not learn core subject skills such as reading, math, science, etc. while this is a valid
            concern, student centered learning takes a holistic approach to teaching students these
            skills. Depending on what the student is interested in learning about, we create a
            curriculum that incorporates core subjects with student interests. Whether students
            are interested in agriculture, design, technology, culinary, veterinary, health, etc.
            we provide a curriculum of mathematics, science, english, and history that intertwines
            with these interests. </p>
          <p><span class="author-text">Haley Fernandez</span></p>
        </div>
        <div class="curriculum-col">
          <h3>Life Skills</h3>
          <p>We try our hardest to introduce students to the skills necessary to support themselves.
            This can look like lessons in cooking, general cleaning, physical and mental hygiene,
            building, and financial literacy. Through play we begin to introduce students to these
            skills early in their time at PCFS, play kitchens, building blocks, and markets
            transition into real world tools we equip the students with by the end of their
            time here.</p>
          <h3>Optional Concentrations/Extracurriculars</h3>
          <p>Older students have the opportunity to gain experience in their specialized areas
            of interest through internal or external community based clubs. The students have
            the ability to create these club opportunities by utilizing volunteers from the
            PCFS staff or community that specialize in the field of interest. These volunteers
            can lead meetings and lessons accordingly and provide a more concentrated perspective
            for the students to learn from. </p>
          <h3>Learning Modalities</h3>
          <p>Inclusive learning encompasses students being provided with the resources best
            suited for their learning style. At PCFS we offer visual, audio, and text based
            learning opportunities. We understand that learning is not a one size fits all approach
            and should be catered to the students needs. This of course also incorporates any ADA
            accommodations necessary to the students as well. </p>

          <h1>Room & Board at PCFS</h1>
          <p>At Philadelphia Community Free School, we believe that students deserve more than
            just a place to stay, they deserve a place to feel safe, comfortable, and at home.
            Our room and board program is specifically designed to support students navigating
            housing instability, including those in foster care or without consistent access to
            shelter.</p>
          <p>Students live in small, residential spaces on campus. Students can choose between
            private or semi-private bedrooms according to their personal needs. The residential
            spaces maintain a lived-in appearance as  students personalize their rooms to match
            their individual preferences. Students can select their personal bedding, lighting
            fixtures and decorative items to make their space represent their individuality and
            preferred style. Each room contains a designated quiet area with either a beanbag
            chair or hammock chair for students to relax or spend time by themselves. There are
            provided storage units which are designed to be locked for protecting personal
            belongings and maintaining individual privacy. Two students can share a room
            together regardless of gender/identity, provided both parties agree to the arrangement.
            Our goal is to create an environment that respects each student’s identity and autonomy.</p>

          <h2>
            Communal Spaces
          </h2>
          <p>Shared spaces in each residence are designed to be warm, functional, and
            community-oriented. Living rooms have comfortable furniture, books, games,
            and space for students to connect naturally. Whether that’s during a group
            check-in, a study session, or just a quiet evening together. Household routines
            and expectations are built collaboratively by students and staff, so the space
            reflects the people living in it. Our Kindness Boards can be located here as well,
            which students are encouraged to interact with. </p>
          <h2>Flexible Meal Plan</h2>
          <p>Students have access to balanced meals prepared by our food service team. These
            meals are crafted to meet nutritional standards appropriate for growing children.
            This ensures they receive the necessary nutrients to succeed academically and
            physically.</p>
          <p>Our meal selections are designed to reflect the diverse cultural backgrounds of
            our student body. We incorporate a variety of cuisines and accommodate dietary
            restrictions to ensure every student feels represented and included with dining
            selections. A lot of these dishes also use ingredients sourced from the Community
            Garden where students grow their own fruits and vegetables.</p>
          <h2>Kitchen Access</h2>
          <p>Each residence features a fully equipped kitchen stocked with essential ingredients
            and healthy snacks. Students are encouraged to prepare their own meals or snacks,
            increasing independence in culinary skills. For our younger students, adult supervision
            is provided to ensure safety during meal preparation.</p>

      <h1>The PCFS Community</h1>
      <p style="color: var(--text-color-light);">At Philadelphia Community Free
        School, we believe that everyone, regardless of their background, has
        something valuable to offer. Our community involvement initiatives are
        designed to empower students to contribute and develop a sense of
        purpose.</p>
      <div class="row">
        <h3>Community Beyond the Campus</h3>
        <p><span class="bold-text">Community Garden:</span> Students collaboratively
          maintain a vibrant garden, growing vegetables, herbs, and flowers.
          This hands-on experience not only teaches sustainable practices but
          also the joy of nurturing and sharing. The produce is used in our school
          meals, and extras are offered through a pay-what-you-can stand for the
          rest of the community.</p>
        <p><span class="bold-text">Art for Community Spaces:</span> Our students channel
          their creativity into projects that brighten various community spaces,
          including local businesses, community centers, nursing homes, and hospitals.
          By crafting and sharing their artwork, they enhance these environments while
          also bringing joy and comfort to those who spend time there. This initiative
          allows students to experience firsthand how their artistic expressions can
          positively impact others, fostering a sense of connection with surrounding
          communities.</p>
        <p><span class="bold-text">Seasonal Toy Drive:</span> Each holiday season,
          our students come together to organize a toy drive, collecting and distributing
          toys and games to local children. For many of our students, who may not have had
          the chance to enjoy such gifts themselves, this holds special meaning. It's a way
          for them to share joy and connect with others throughout the community, embodying
          the spirit of what holidays are about.</p>
        <p><span class="bold-text">Cultural Heritage Fair:</span> Each year we at PCFS
          encourage celebrating the rich mix of cultures that make up our community.
          The Cultural Heritage Fair is where local community members come in to share
          their traditions, stories, and customs with our students. It's an opportunity
          for students to dive into different cultures; exploring traditional clothing,
          music, dance, crafts, and food. Students who want to share and learn more about
          their own cultural backgrounds are also encouraged to participate. This inclusive
          event strengthens the bonds within our community, reflecting our commitment to
          diversity and cultural knowledge that is maintained at the school.</p>

        <h3>Within the School</h3>
        <p><span class="bold-text">Pantry Box:</span> Within our school, students manage a pantry stocked with snacks, hygiene items, and essentials accessible to any student who may need it. By participating in stocking and organizing, students learn the importance of mutual aid. Handwritten notes of encouragement included in the pantry serve as reminders of the community they are helping to build.</p>
        <p><span class="bold-text">Kindness Boards:</span> Throughout our campus, Kindness Boards serve as daily reminders to our students of the power of positive affirmations. Located in academic buildings, communal areas within student housing, and other shared spaces. These boards invite students to share encouragement, and supportive messages. This initiative builds a culture of empathy and mutual respect, emphasizing the importance of kindness in both academic and personal settings.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="community-bottom">
        <p>We believe that learning extends beyond the classroom and into the community. By participating in these initiatives, students experience how their actions can make a positive impact, reinforcing our commitment to self-directed learning and mutual respect. It's about empowering them to recognize their potential to initiate change and understanding the strength of a supportive, student-driven community.</p>
