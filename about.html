    <!--- Our Curriculum --->
    <section class="curriculum full-bleed-dark" id="curriculum">
      <h1>Our Curriculum</h1>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="curriculum-col">
          <p>At PCFS our curriculum is built around student centered learning. We encourage
            self discovery and encourage students' individual interest by providing them with
            optional concentrations in specialized subjects. </p>
          <h3>Cultivating Interest</h3>
          <p>Students are exposed to a wide range of interests through their early education at
            PCFS. Through play based learning the students are encouraged to pursue their interests
            and explore the potential careers society has to offer. Learning and exploring these
            options through play in early development can cultivate a natural curiosity and
            excitement for learning to carry the students through schooling with purpose. </p>
          <h3>Core Subjects</h3>
          <p>A large concern surrounding student centered learning is the fear that students will
            not learn core subject skills such as reading, math, science, etc. while this is a valid
            concern, student centered learning takes a holistic approach to teaching students these
            skills. Depending on what the student is interested in learning about, we create a
            curriculum that incorporates core subjects with student interests. Whether students
            are interested in agriculture, design, technology, culinary, veterinary, health, etc.
            we provide a curriculum of mathematics, science, english, and history that intertwines
            with these interests. </p>

        <div class="curriculum-col">
          <h3>Life Skills</h3>
          <p>We try our hardest to introduce students to the skills necessary to support themselves.
            This can look like lessons in cooking, general cleaning, physical and mental hygiene,
            building, and financial literacy. Through play we begin to introduce students to these
            skills early in their time at PCFS, play kitchens, building blocks, and markets
            transition into real world tools we equip the students with by the end of their
            time here.</p>
          <h3>Optional Concentrations/Extracurriculars</h3>
          <p>Older students have the opportunity to gain experience in their specialized areas
            of interest through internal or external community based clubs. The students have
            the ability to create these club opportunities by utilizing volunteers from the
            PCFS staff or community that specialize in the field of interest. These volunteers
            can lead meetings and lessons accordingly and provide a more concentrated perspective
            for the students to learn from. </p>
          <h3>Learning Modalities</h3>
          <p>Inclusive learning encompasses students being provided with the resources best
            suited for their learning style. At PCFS we offer visual, audio, and text based
            learning opportunities. We understand that learning is not a one size fits all approach
            and should be catered to the students needs. This of course also incorporates any ADA
            accommodations necessary to the students as well. </p>

    <!--- Room & Board --->

        <div class="about-col">
          <h1>Room & Board at PCFS</h1>
          <p>At Philadelphia Community Free School, we believe that students deserve more than
            just a place to stay, they deserve a place to feel safe, comfortable, and at home.
            Our room and board program is specifically designed to support students navigating
            housing instability, including those in foster care or without consistent access to
            shelter.</p>
          <p>Students live in small, residential spaces on campus. Students can choose between
            private or semi-private bedrooms according to their personal needs. The residential
            spaces maintain a lived-in appearance as  students personalize their rooms to match
            their individual preferences. Students can select their personal bedding, lighting
            fixtures and decorative items to make their space represent their individuality and
            preferred style. Each room contains a designated quiet area with either a beanbag
            chair or hammock chair for students to relax or spend time by themselves. There are
            provided storage units which are designed to be locked for protecting personal
            belongings and maintaining individual privacy. Two students can share a room
            together regardless of gender/identity, provided both parties agree to the arrangement.
            Our goal is to create an environment that respects each student’s identity and autonomy.</p>

          <h2>
            Communal Spaces
          </h2>
          <p>Shared spaces in each residence are designed to be warm, functional, and
            community-oriented. Living rooms have comfortable furniture, books, games,
            and space for students to connect naturally. Whether that’s during a group
            check-in, a study session, or just a quiet evening together. Household routines
            and expectations are built collaboratively by students and staff, so the space
            reflects the people living in it. Our Kindness Boards can be located here as well,
            which students are encouraged to interact with. </p>
          <h2>Flexible Meal Plan</h2>
          <p>Students have access to balanced meals prepared by our food service team. These
            meals are crafted to meet nutritional standards appropriate for growing children.
            This ensures they receive the necessary nutrients to succeed academically and
            physically.</p>
          <p>Our meal selections are designed to reflect the diverse cultural backgrounds of
            our student body. We incorporate a variety of cuisines and accommodate dietary
            restrictions to ensure every student feels represented and included with dining
            selections. A lot of these dishes also use ingredients sourced from the Community
            Garden where students grow their own fruits and vegetables.</p>
          <h2>Kitchen Access</h2>
          <p>Each residence features a fully equipped kitchen stocked with essential ingredients
            and healthy snacks. Students are encouraged to prepare their own meals or snacks,
            increasing independence in culinary skills. For our younger students, adult supervision
            is provided to ensure safety during meal preparation.</p>
