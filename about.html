          <h1>The Future of Schooling</h1>
          <p>Born from the ashes of a broken education system, the Philadelphia Community Free
            School is a revolutionary rethinking of what education can look like. We are
            a K–8 school dedicated to diversity, equity, and well-being—built for students
            from all kinds of backgrounds. We are student-driven, rooted in free school
            philosophy of the past, and founded on the belief that education can be liberating,
            not restrictive.</p>
          <p>Education here takes place in secure, home-like environments, with accompanying
            mental health and medical treatment all on-site through our wellness center. We
            are proud to provide boarding for homeless and fostered youth, giving them a
            stable, nurturing environment where they can grow and thrive. Classrooms are
            adapted to different learning styles through multimedia resources like videos
            and audiobooks.</p>
          <p>Fundamentally supported in the same manner as public schools, we are also still
            community-driven—having events and drives to emphasize the importance of community.
            The Philadelphia Community Free School is not just some place to be educated—it is
            home and a movement toward something greater.</p>

    <!--- Our Curriculum --->
    <section class="curriculum full-bleed-dark" id="curriculum">
      <h1>Our Curriculum</h1>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="curriculum-col">
          <p>At PCFS our curriculum is built around student centered learning. We encourage
            self discovery and encourage students' individual interest by providing them with
            optional concentrations in specialized subjects. </p>
          <h3>Cultivating Interest</h3>
          <p>Students are exposed to a wide range of interests through their early education at
            PCFS. Through play based learning the students are encouraged to pursue their interests
            and explore the potential careers society has to offer. Learning and exploring these
            options through play in early development can cultivate a natural curiosity and
            excitement for learning to carry the students through schooling with purpose. </p>
          <h3>Core Subjects</h3>
          <p>A large concern surrounding student centered learning is the fear that students will
            not learn core subject skills such as reading, math, science, etc. while this is a valid
            concern, student centered learning takes a holistic approach to teaching students these
            skills. Depending on what the student is interested in learning about, we create a
            curriculum that incorporates core subjects with student interests. Whether students
            are interested in agriculture, design, technology, culinary, veterinary, health, etc.
            we provide a curriculum of mathematics, science, english, and history that intertwines
            with these interests. </p>
          <p><span class="author-text">Haley Fernandez</span></p>
        </div>
        <div class="curriculum-col">
          <h3>Life Skills</h3>
          <p>We try our hardest to introduce students to the skills necessary to support themselves.
            This can look like lessons in cooking, general cleaning, physical and mental hygiene,
            building, and financial literacy. Through play we begin to introduce students to these
            skills early in their time at PCFS, play kitchens, building blocks, and markets
            transition into real world tools we equip the students with by the end of their
            time here.</p>
          <h3>Optional Concentrations <br>and Extracurriculars</h3>
          <p>Older students have the opportunity to gain experience in their specialized areas
            of interest through internal or external community based clubs. The students have
            the ability to create these club opportunities by utilizing volunteers from the
            PCFS staff or community that specialize in the field of interest. These volunteers
            can lead meetings and lessons accordingly and provide a more concentrated perspective
            for the students to learn from. </p>
          <h3>Learning Modalities</h3>
          <p>Inclusive learning encompasses students being provided with the resources best
            suited for their learning style. At PCFS we offer visual, audio, and text based
            learning opportunities. We understand that learning is not a one size fits all approach
            and should be catered to the students needs. This of course also incorporates any ADA
            accommodations necessary to the students as well. </p>

        <div class="about-col">
          <h1>Room & Board at PCFS</h1>
          <p>At Philadelphia Community Free School, we believe that students deserve more than
            just a place to stay, they deserve a place to feel safe, comfortable, and most
            importantly at home. Our room and board program is specifically designed to
            support students navigating housing instability, including those in foster
            care or without consistent access to shelter.</p>
          <p>Students reside in small, residential spaces on campus. They’re also given the
            choice of a private or semi-private bedroom based on their personal needs. The
            residential spaces maintain a lived-in feel as students personalize their rooms
            to match their preferences and interests. Students can select their bedding,
            lighting fixtures, and decorative accessories to make their space represent
            their individuality and preferred style. Each room contains a designated
            quiet area with either a beanbag chair or hammock for students to relax
            or spend time by themselves. There are provided storage lockers which
            are designed to be locked for protecting personal belongings and
            maintaining privacy. Two students may share a room regardless of
            gender/identity, provided both parties are in agreement with the
            arrangement. At PCFS we aim to establish an environment that
            respects each student’s identity and autonomy.</p>

          <h2>
            Communal Spaces
          </h2>
          <p>Shared spaces in each residence are designed to be inviting, functional,
            and community-oriented. Living rooms have comfortable furniture, books, games,
            and space for students to connect in a setting that feels natural. Whether that’s
            during a group check-in, a study group, or just a weekend hangout. Daily routines
            and expectations are built collaboratively by students and the staff, so the space
            reflects the people living in it. Our Kindness Boards can also be found here as
            well, which students are encouraged to interact with.</p>
          <h2>Flexible Meal Plan</h2>
          <p>Students have access to balanced meals provided and prepared by our catering
            staff. The meals are crafted to satisfy nutritional standards appropriate for
            growing children. This ensures they will have everything they need and receive
            the necessary nutrients for success. Not limited purely to physical success
            but academic as well.</p>
          <p>Our meal options are designed to reflect the diversity of cultures within
            our student body. We offer a wide range of cuisines and provide dietary
            accommodations. This is to ensure every student feels represented and
            included in the dining selections. A lot of these dishes also use
            produce grown right here at PCFS, sourced directly from the Community
            Garden where students grow their own fruits and vegetables.</p>
          <h2>Kitchen Access</h2>
          <p>Each residence hall features a completed kitchen that is stocked
            with an assortment of various ingredients and nutritious snacks.
            Students are encouraged to prepare their snacks or meals, further
            fostering greater independence in culinary skills. For our younger
            students, adult supervision is provided to ensure safety during meal
            preparation.</p>
          <h2>Wellness Rooms</h2>
          <p>These are calm, sensory-friendly spaces that students can visit when they need to refocus or recharge. These rooms have dim lighting, cozy seating, art supplies, and more. Students can use them freely and unlimitedly, whether for journaling, meditating, or just for time alone. Wellness staff are available for optional check-ins, but the space is designed to be student-centered and non-clinical.</p>
          <p>Our housing is designed to be student-focused, from the atmosphere of the buildings to the freedom they have within them. It’s made to be comfortable, consistent and convey a sense of belonging, especially for those who need it most.</p>

      <h1>The PCFS Community</h1>
      <p style="color: var(--text-color-light);">At Philadelphia Community Free School,
        we believe that everyone, regardless of their background, has something valuable
        to offer. Our community involvement initiatives are designed to empower students
        to contribute and develop a sense of purpose.</p>
      <div class="row">
        <h3>Community Beyond the Campus</h3>
        <p><span class="bold-text">Community Garden:</span> Students collaboratively
          maintain a lush garden, growing vegetables, herbs, and flowers.
          This hands-on experience teaches not only sustainable practices but
          also the joy of growing and sharing. The produce is used in our
          school meals, and excess is offered through a pay-what-you-can
          stand to the remainder of the community.</p>
        <p><span class="bold-text">Art for Community Spaces:</span> Our students channel
          their creativity into artwork that enhances community spaces like local
          businesses, community centers, nursing homes, and hospitals. By creating
          and donating their artwork, students not only contribute to the
          atmospheres of these spaces but also bring joy and comfort to the
          people who utilize them. This project allows students to experience
          firsthand how their artwork can positively impact the lives of others,
          giving them a sense of connection with the communities that surround them.</p>
        <p><span class="bold-text">Seasonal Toy Drive:</span> Each holiday season,
          our students come together to organize a Toy Drive, donating (new or used)
          toys and games to local children. This is a particularly exciting time of
          year for many of our students, as some may not have had the opportunities
          to enjoy such gifts themselves when growing up. It's a way for them to give
          back and connect with others within the community providing them with the
          spirit of giving, which is what the holidays are all about!</p>
        <p><span class="bold-text">Cultural Heritage Fair:</span> Here at PCFS we
          celebrate the diverse range of cultures that make up our community
          each year. The Cultural Heritage Fair is where members of the local
          community visit to share their traditions, stories, and customs with our
          students. It's a chance for students to learn about different cultures;
          and explore traditional clothing, music, dance, crafts, and food.
          Students are also invited to join who wish to share and learn more
          about their cultural backgrounds. This inclusive event is a way of
          strengthening the bonds within our community, ultimately reflecting
          our commitment to diversity and cultural knowledge that is maintained
          at the school!</p>

        <h3>Within the School</h3>
        <p><span class="bold-text">Pantry Box:</span> At our school, students operate a pantry stocked with snacks, personal hygiene items, and necessities free to be used by any student who needs them. Through participating in stocking and organizing, students discover the value of mutual aid. Handwritten notes of encouragement scattered throughout the pantry serve as reminders of the community they are helping to build.</p>
        <p><span class="bold-text">Kindness Boards:</span> Kindness Boards are a daily reminder to our students of the power and impact of positive affirmations. Located in academic buildings, residence hall common areas, and other shared spaces. These boards invite students to share words of affirmation and supportive messages. This initiative builds a culture of mutual respect and empathy, emphasizing the importance of kindness in both academic and personal contexts.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="community-bottom">
        <p>We believe that education extends beyond the walls of the classroom and out into the community. By participating in these programs and initiatives, students experience how their actions can make a difference in their community. This reinforces our commitment to self-directed learning and mutual respect. It's about empowering students to recognize their potential to initiate change and to realize the strength of a collaborative, student-driven community.</p>
